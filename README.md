Docker has containers.
Vagrant has boxes.
We have tubs.

A 'tub' for running Web-app that reports and logs infomation back to boss and starts the Web-app on the local machine or a docker container

**NOTICE**: We were originally planning to call this 'container', but we thought it was copying docker.
